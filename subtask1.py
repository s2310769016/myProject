#This code finds the largest square number which is smaller than given number

n = int(input("Enter a number: ")) #This is the input part. It takes the given string and turns it to integer.
q=1 

while (n >= q*q): # This part finds the largest square number which is smaller than the input
    q=q+1 #If the inpu is bigger that the q*q it increases q by 1. 

q=q-1 #When it finds the value for q which its square is bigger than the input it reduces q by 1

print ("The largest square number: ") #Then it prints the result
print (q*q)

# it looks like I learned how to use git today
